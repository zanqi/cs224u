    "The goal of this homework is to explore retrieval-augmented in-context learning. This is an exciting area that brings together a number of recent task ideas and modeling innovations. We will use the [DSP programming library](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dsp) to build systems in this new mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our core task is __open-domain question answering (OpenQA)__. In this task, all that is given by the dataset is a question text, and the task is to answer that question. By contrast, in modern QA tasks, the dataset provides a text and a gold passage, usually with a firm guarantee that the answer will be a substring of the passage. \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenQA is substantially harder than standard QA. The usual strategy is to use a _retriever_ to find passages in a large collection of texts and train a _reader_ to find answers in those passages. This means we have no guarantee that the retrieved passage will contain the answer we need. If we don't retrieve a passage containing the answer, our reader has no hope of succeeding. Although this is challenging, it is much more realistic and widely applicable than standard QA. After all, with the right retriever, an OpenQA system could be deployed over the entire Web.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task posed by this homework is harder even than OpenQA. We are calling this task __few-shot OpenQA__. The defining feature of this task is that the reader is simply a frozen, general purpose language model. It accepts string inputs (prompts) and produces text in response. It is not trained to answer questions per se, and nothing about its structure ensures that it will respond with a substring of the prompt corresponding to anything like an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Few-shot QA__ (but not OpenQA!) is explored in the famous GPT-3 paper ([Brown et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)). The authors are able to get traction on the problem using GPT-3, an incredible finding. Our task here – __few-shot OpenQA__ – pushes this even further by retrieving passages to use in the prompt rather than assuming that the gold passage can be used in the prompt. If we can make this work, then it should be a major step towards flexibly and easily deploying QA technologies in new domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",

    "Just to repeat: your mission is to explore the final line in this table. The core notebook and assignment don't address the issue of training the retriever in a task-specific way, but this is something you could pursue for a final project; [the ColBERT codebase](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) makes easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, this notebook sets up the task and provides starter code. We will be relying on the DSP library, which allows us to define retrieval-augmented in-context learning systems in code. We first provide two fully implemented examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Few-shot OpenQA_: The given input is a question and the goal is to provide an answer. Some _demonstration_ Q/A pairs are sampled from a train set (in our case, SQuAD).\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Few-shot QA with context_: The given input is a question with an associated evidence passage, and the goal is to provide an answer. The _demonstrations_ are now Q/A pairs with associated gold evidence passages. These are sampled from a train set (in our case, SQuAD).\n",
    "\n",
    "The above examples are followed by some assignment questions aimed at helping you to think creatively about the problem. The first of these defines a core system for our target task:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Few-shot OpenQA with context_: This is like _few-shot QA with context_ except the passages are now retrieved from a large search index using ColBERT. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second question illustrates how to use the powerful DSP `annotate` function to improve the set of demonstrations used by the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a requirement of the bake-off that a general-purpose language model be used. In particular, trained QA systems cannot be used at all, and no fine-tuning is allowed either. See the original system question at the bottom of this message for guidance on which models are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the models we are working with here are _big_. This poses a challenge that is increasingly common in NLP: you have to pay one way or another. You can pay to use the GPT-3 API, or you can pay to use an Eleuther model on a heavy-duty cluster computer, or you can pay with time by using an Eleuther model on a more modest computer.  __For now, though, the Cohere models are free to use, so they should be your first choice; see [setup.ipynb](setup.ipynb) if you don't have an account__."

      "From the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style. On the other hand, some regions such as England and Spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops. Regional differences that are apparent in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period often become even more apparent in the Gothic.\n",

Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".\n",

Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism's immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.\n",

      "From the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style. On the other hand, some regions such as England and Spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops. Regional differences that are apparent in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period often become even more apparent in the Gothic.\n",
