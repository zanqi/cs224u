    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "* The focus of this notebook is __building feature representations__ for use with (mostly linear) classifiers (though you're encouraged to try out some non-linear ones as well!).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The core characteristics of the feature functions we'll build here:\n",
    "   * They represent examples in __very large, very sparse feature spaces__.\n",
    "   * The individual feature functions can be __highly refined__, drawing on expert human knowledge of the domain. \n",
    "   * Taken together, these representations don't comprehensively represent the input examples. They just identify aspects of the inputs that the classifier model can make good use of (we hope).\n",
    "   \n",
    "* These classifiers tend to be __highly competitive__. We'll look at more powerful deep learning models in the next notebook, and it will immediately become apparent that it is very difficult to get them to measure up to well-built classifiers based in sparse feature representations. It can be done, but it tends to require a lot of attention to optimization details (and potentially a lot of compute resources).\n",
    "\n",
    "* For this notebook, we look in detail at just two very general strategies for featurization: unigram-based and bigram-based. This gives us a chance to introduce core concepts in optimization. The [associated homework](hw_sst.ipynb) is oriented towards designing more specialized, linguistically intricate feature functions."

    "## Basic optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now in a position to begin training supervised models!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, in this course, we will not study the theoretical aspects of machine learning optimization, concentrating instead on how to optimize systems effectively in practice. That is, this isn't a theory course, but rather an experimental, project-oriented one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, we do want to avoid treating our optimizers as black boxes that work their magic and give us some assessment figures for whatever we feed into them. That seems irresponsible from a scientific and engineering perspective, and it also sends the false signal that the optimization process is inherently mysterious. So we do want to take a minute to demystify it with some simple code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `np_sgd_classifier` contains a complete optimization framework, as `BasicSGDClassifier`. Well, it's complete in the sense that it achieves our full task of supervised learning. It's incomplete in the sense that it is very basic. You probably wouldn't want to use it in experiments. Rather, we're going to encourage you to rely on `sklearn` for your experiments (see below). Still, this is a good basic picture of what's happening under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is `BasicSGDClassifier` doing? The heart of it is the `fit` function (reflecting the usual `sklearn` naming system). This method implements a hinge-loss stochastic sub-gradient descent optimization. Intuitively, it works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by assuming that all the feature weights are `0`.\n",
    "1. Move through the dataset instance-by-instance in random order.\n",
    "1. For each instance, classify it using the current weights. \n",
    "1. If the classification is incorrect, move the weights in the direction of the correct classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This process repeats for a user-specified number of iterations (default `10` below), and the weight movement is tempered by a learning-rate parameter `eta` (default `0.1`). The output is a set of weights that can be used to make predictions about new (properly featurized) examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more technical terms, the objective function is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\min_{\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}}\n",
    "  \\sum_{(x,y)\\in\\mathcal{D}} \n",
    "  \\max_{y'\\in\\mathbf{Y}}\n",
    "  \\left[\\mathbf{Score}_{\\textbf{w}, \\phi}(x,y') + \\mathbf{cost}(y,y')\\right] - \\mathbf{Score}_{\\textbf{w}, \\phi}(x,y)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{w}$ is the set of weights to be learned, $\\mathcal{D}$ is the training set of example&ndash;label pairs, $\\mathbf{Y}$ is the set of labels, $\\mathbf{cost}(y,y') = 0$ if $y=y'$, else $1$, and $\\mathbf{Score}_{\\textbf{w}, \\phi}(x,y')$ is the inner product of the weights \n",
    "$\\mathbf{w}$ and the example as featurized according to $\\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fit` method is then calculating the sub-gradient of this objective. In succinct pseudo-code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initialize $\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{0}$\n",
    "* Repeat $T$ times:\n",
    "    * for each $(x,y) \\in \\mathcal{D}$ (in random order):\n",
    "        * $\\tilde{y} = \\text{argmax}_{y'\\in \\mathcal{Y}} \\mathbf{Score}_{\\textbf{w}, \\phi}(x,y') + \\mathbf{cost}(y,y')$\n",
    "        * $\\mathbf{w} =  \\mathbf{w} + \\eta(\\phi(x,y) - \\phi(x,\\tilde{y}))$\n",
    "        \n",
    "This is very intuitive – push the weights in the direction of the positive cases. It doesn't require any probability theory. And such loss functions have proven highly effective in many settings. For a more powerful version of this classifier, see [sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html#sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier). With `loss='hinge'`, it should behave much like `BasicSGDClassifier` (but faster!).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, the classifiers that we use in this course have a softmax objective function. The module [np_shallow_neural_classifier.py](np_shallow_neural_classifier.py) is a straightforward example. The precise calculations are a bit less transparent than those for `BasicSGDClassifier`, but the general logic is the same for both."
